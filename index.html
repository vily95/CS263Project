            <p><b>Objective:</b> The use of VR systems have been shown to be effective in psychotherapy, physiotherapy, and tele-rehabilitation.

                Data collected from my lab on this project, DANSER lab also has more data from user testing from the star catcher project, a VR game to help with therapy, as well as data from motion capture system. The data captured could be useful for physical therapists to anlayze how their patients are progressing throughout VR therapy.

            <p><b>Objective:</b> I'm proposing to make a timeline of progression of VR Therapy for stroke victims from these users from my lab's study. I would like to compare their results with traditional constraint induced movement therapy. It would also be necessary to see a comparison between prices of CIMT (Constraint induced movement therapy) vs the price of a VR system</p>

                Data collected from my lab on this project, DANSER lab also has more data from user testing from the star catcher project, a VR game to help with therapy, as well as data from motion capture system. The data captured could be useful for physical therapists to anlayze how their patients are progressing throughout VR therapy.

                 - According to the U.S National Institutes of
                Health, more than 700,000 people suffer a stroke each year in the U.S alone.

                 -68 of particients said they were they were unlikely to adhere to protocol to continue CIMT.
                
                Gathering data on the prices of VR systems will range from $599+
